# IDXBroker-GETs
Sample get calls for the IDX Broker API

Standard Disclaimer: This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code.

All calls will be a simple call for leads. Endpoint used: https://api.idxbroker.com/leads/lead


Since the IDX Broker docs are all PHP I decided to create an example of a leads call in various other languages.

All request headers Must be lower case.
